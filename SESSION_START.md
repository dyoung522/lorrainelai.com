# Session Start Reminder

When starting a new Claude Code session for this project, use this prompt:

```
Read RUBY.md, RAILS.md, and WEBUI.md from /home/dyoung/.claude/ before starting work.
```

This ensures Claude is aware of:
- Ruby best practices and idioms (RUBY.md)
- Rails conventions, especially using encrypted credentials over ENV (RAILS.md)
- Frontend/UI design guidelines (WEBUI.md)

These files provide essential context that supplements the project-specific guidance in CLAUDE.md.
